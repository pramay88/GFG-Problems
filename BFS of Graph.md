Given a undirected graph represented by an adjacency list adj, which is a vector of vectors where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. Perform a Breadth First Traversal (BFS) starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right according to the adjacency list, and return a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph.

Note: Do traverse in the same order as they are in the adjacency list.

Examples:
